        <br><br>
        <p class="text-left">
          Recycling is the decade’s old approach but upcycling the waste and turning it into something beautiful and blending with the modern architectural trend. With the growing approach to the concept of Zero waste including this aspect in the field of architecture is a challenge that’s worth exploring.
          <br><br>
          As the cities are growing, the pile of waste is growing exponentially making our cities vulnerable to get a solution for it and to preserve the integrity of the place we are living on.one of the fastest growing city in India is Amaechi Mumbai, the city that never sleeps and keeps running on its wheels has also become the most polluted city. Mumbai generates about 7000MT of construction waste per day and managing this waste is a big challenge.
          <br><br>
          With the growing trend of architecture and blend of ancient and modern concepts have become a new way to go. For this concept the use of waste and its upcycling plays a major role. One of the most impressive examples of this blend is The Collage House located in the heart of the overcrowded Mumbai city. This house is sandwiched between two houses with no landscape in vision but still, the house has the element of surprise like nowhere else and that too by using waste.
          <br><br>
          The house is entirely made up of recycled materials. These materials range from over 125 years old wooden doors taken from scrap yard to use salvaged mirrors. The entire house design is an architect’s delight. It is just amazing to look at the concept of how things are thrown in the trash can be upcycled to something so beautiful be it the walls made up of thrown printing blocks or the entire front Façade made up of windows and doors picked up from the scrap yard or demolition sites.

          Everything this house has incorporated is upcycled including the headboards and wardrobes which are made from the old discarded photo frames. The house boasts of stones used for the walls and the pillars for the skylight on the roof deck were also being a part picked from the waste. Even though all these were trash going to dumping ground, the architecture of these houses has turned it to an incredible design concept that can be adopted anywhere and everywhere..

          This upcycling is not limited to the rooms or elevation it goes on and on in every corner of the house including the bathrooms. The washrooms are housing the salvaged mirrors from bottom to ceilings in the most extraordinary way possible. The pipes are also upcycled from metal scrap and blended in design. The water outlet PVC pipes are also picked up from the trash and incorporated to create a beautiful aesthetic that blends with the nature of this house. The amalgamation of these waste is not only increasing its value but creating a sense of respecting nature beautifully And as we say the house is not home until it feels like one, this house just has the exact ownness to it with all its unique features.

          This house sets the example of how the trash can be converted to real use and can be incorporated in the modern design outlook. It is purposeful, resourceful and a refreshing concept. This house due to its unique concepts was also selected as the most extraordinary home in the world by BBC for its broadcast. It is not the house it is a home for four generations and this upcycling is not only their way to pay homage to mother nature but also to respect their past and progress with the future.
          <br><br>
          This use of waste in the architectural design shows us the way forward for protecting the environment and becoming the part of a community that cares for nature. The amount of waste we are generating is beyond imagination so this was just a small approach to use that waste and make the best of it. After all, that’s the beauty of waste.
