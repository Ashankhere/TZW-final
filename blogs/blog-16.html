        <br><br>
        <p class="text-left">
          Hello everyone!
          <br><br>
          We order online a lot these days and the majority of our orders from Dominos to Pizza Hut to Amazon, Flipkart, etc. comes in cardboard packaging. We do have a lot of cardboards at our home as well. Now, what to do with them?. Well, I have a very trivial and efficient way for you to handle your cardboards. You can use them in composting!. So, let’s get down straight to it.

            <i>Essential ingredient in compost</i>
            <br><br>

          <b>Why is cardboard essential for composting ?</b>
          <br><br>
          Of the many elements required for microbial decomposition, carbon and nitrogen are the most important. Carbon provides both an energy source and the basic building block making up about 50 percent of the mass of microbial cells. Nitrogen is a crucial component of the proteins, nucleic acids, amino acids, enzymes, and co-enzymes necessary for cell growth and function.
          The components added to a compost heap, be it grass clippings, vegetable peelings and more, are usually rich in nitrogen. Now, since cardboard is so rich in carbon (The carbon- nitrogen ratio of cardboard is 200:1), it is brilliant for balancing the compost because carbon, and nitrogen reactions allow our garden compost to decompose quicker.
          <br><br>

        <p class="text-left">

          Now If I say this in a bit more scientific way this is how it goes: To provide optimal amounts of these two crucial elements, you can use the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio for each of your compost ingredients. The ideal C/N ratio for composting is generally considered to be around 30:1, or 30 parts carbon for each part nitrogen by weight. Why 30:1? At lower ratios, nitrogen will be supplied in excess and will be lost as ammonia gas, causing undesirable odors. Higher ratios mean that there is not sufficient nitrogen for optimal growth of the microbial populations, so the compost will remain relatively cool and degradation will proceed at a slow rate. This is it about why cardboard in composting?, now let’s proceed to the practical.
          <br><br>
          <b>How to use cardboard in the compost heap?</b>
          <br><br>
          Gabbar Singh has a very famous dialogue if you have watched ‘Sholay’. He gave a profound statement regarding composting. He said – “Jo gad gya, woh sad gya (what is buried is rotten)”. He is talking about the basic principle of composting. Well enough of this reference thing, let’s get down to business.
          Now before everything else, it is critical that all the cardboard to be composted is broken into small pieces. Large pieces will not decompose as quickly. Also, soaking the cardboard in water with a bit of liquid detergent will help to speed up the decomposition process. Now let me take you through the step by step guide of composting.
          <br><br>
          Step 1 : Begin your compost pile with a layer of shredded corrugated cardboard with other high-carbon materials such as straw, old hay or dead leaves.
          <br>
          Step 2 : Add a layer of nitrogen rich materials on top of the cardboard such as fresh grass clippings, horse or cow manure, spoiled vegetables or fruit peels.
          <br>
          Step 3: Add a layer of soil on top of this layer.
          <br>
          Step 4 : Continue to layer in this fashion until the pile is approximately 4 cubic feet. It is imperative that the compost pile be kept about as moist as a sponge. Add more water or cardboard depending on how wet it feels. The cardboard will soak up any excess water and thus you’ll not have to face the very common ‘water logging’ problem in composting.
          <br><br>
          And guess what, you have your bank account ready from which you’ll be eligible to withdraw after 3-4 months. Well, you did a great job!
          <br><br>
          Some people also use buckets and utensils for cardboard composting. But after composting in this way, the black leach is produced, it smells bad. Maggots, flies, and insects can also thrive there. Therefore, the best way is ‘Jo gad gya, woh sad gya’, that is, bury this in soil. Bury it in the earth. Now, if you don’t have spare land for composting, which is the case in metropolitan cities, you can use your nearby park for this. So this is the easiest way to create compost (don’t forget to use cardboard) – no foul, no insects, no flies.
          <br><br>
          So do remember –<b> ‘Jo gad gya, woh sad gya’.</b>
