        <br><br>
        <p class="text-left">
          Globally, the human race is witness to a global pandemic due to outbreak the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a need of treatment for various contaminants from human waste before disposal, to safeguard the human health and harmful effect to the natural environment. Sanitary waste disposal has become an increasing problem in India as the plastic used in disposable sanitary napkins are not bio-degradable and lead to health and environmental hazards. Menstruation wastes are the wastes that are generated by a female in her reproductive years. Menstrual waste is disposed as part of routine waste ending up in general waste or flushed down toilets. Each poses a different type of risk to the environment. Burning releases carcinogenic fumes in the form of dioxins and furans. India has 12.3 billion disposable sanitary napkins to take care of every year, majority of which are not biodegradable/compostable. Poor menstrual hygiene and inadequate self-care are major determinants of morbidity and other complications among this age group. Some of these problems include urinary tract infections, scabies in the vaginal area, abnormal abdominal pain, absence from school, and complications during pregnancy (Haque et al. 2014). Menstruation is still regarded as unclean or dirty in many developing countries.
          <br><br><br>
          <b>What are sanitary waste and its importance?</b>
          <br><br>
          Soiled napkins, diapers, condoms, tampons and blood-soaked cotton, which are household waste according to the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, are being disposed after segregation into biodegradable and non-biodegradable components. However, the BioMedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 indicate that items contaminated with blood and body fluids, including cotton, dressings, soiled plaster casts, lines and bedding, are bio-medical waste and should be incinerated, autoclaved or microwaved to destroy pathogens (CPCB 2018).

        <p class="text-left">

          Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) is an integral part of the Swachh Bharat Mission Guidelines (SBM-G). The MHM Guideline (Dec 2015) is issued by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation to support all adolescent girls and women. As per MHM guidelines, ‘Safe disposal’ means ensuring that the process of destruction of used and soiled materials is done without human contact and with minimal environmental pollution and ‘Unsafe disposal’ means throwing used cloth into ponds, rivers, or in the fields exposes others in the area to decaying material and should be avoided. Offsite disposal can be organized with the communal or town solid waste collection and management system. If a hospital with a safe and treatment unit for hazardous waste is nearby, this might be a best solution to explore. However, this is unfortunately not a viable option for many rural schools, and transport will be a logistical and financial challenge. Options for on-site disposal include disposal deep burial, composting, pit burning and incineration. The right option depends on key factors such as amount and type of materials, the available budget (investment and O&M costs) and environmental considerations. Burning in open heap should be totally avoided. If burning is the only option, a deep pit should be used.

          <b>Provisions of Sanitary Wastes in Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016:</b>
          <br><br>
          Solid Waste Management, Rules, 2016 and the objections and suggestions received from the public, the Government of India through CPCB has framed the guidelines on sanitary waste management to ensure proper disposal of sanitary waste.

          (iv) All such manufacturers, brand owners or marketing companies shall educate the masses for wrapping and disposal of their products.
          <br><br><br>
          <b>Menstrual waste management</b>
          <br><br>
          Menstruation is a natural, normal biological process experienced by all adolescent girls and women, yet it is not spoken about openly causing unnecessary embarrassment and shame (UNICEF 2018). India’s 113 million adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable at the onset of menarche. At this time, they need a safe environment that offers protection and guidance to ensure their basic health, well-being and educational opportunity is realised (Haque et al. 2014; India 2017).
          <br><br><br>
          <b>Situational analysis of menstrual waste management in India</b>
          <br><br>
          Taking cognizance from the present scenario there is a need to review the waste generated and awareness of the people on menstrual waste. Therefore, menstrual waste management now be of primary concern and processes should be selected, designed and modified accordingly. A community-based cross-sectional study on practices about menstrual waste disposal were studied among the reproductive age group women residing in an urban resettlement institute of Bombay. Qualitative survey was conducted to understand the knowledge on menstrual waste production and its disposal. This study aimed in to fill the gaps of in waste management sector on menstrual waste knowledge and its safe disposal measures need to be undertaken.

          Sanitary products used by the females in India
          <br><br>
          Menstruation is still a taboo in India and it is common for people across society to feel uncomfortable about the subject. Coupled with it, is the fact that there is lack of information on the process of menstruation, and proper requirements for managing menstruation. The taboos surrounding this issue in the society prevents girls and women from articulating their needs and the problems of poor menstrual hygiene management have been largely ignored or misunderstood. Good menstrual hygiene is crucial for the health, education, and dignity of girls and women. Pads has been used by the most of females in India, only 4% of the females uses reusable pads. It is good sign to see that 11% of females uses cups, however, this can’t be considered for whole Indian population as this survey has been conducted in the well-educated community.

          <b>Motivation behind using the reusable pads by the females in India</b>
          <br><br>
          It is important that the wider society, communities and families must challenge the status quo and break the silence around menstruation. There is a need to change family and community norms and beliefs in this regard. Not being able to talk about their experience and having limited information means that menstruation becomes something to be ashamed of and to hide, and is consequently ignored in families, schools and communities. In many families, the mother has limited experience in explaining the management of menstruation with regard to schooling, mobility or outdoor activities. When we asked on motivation behind the usage of reusable pads, it was found that 70% of women mentioned on environmental concerns, whereas 30% mentioned about health issues caused by using normal pads which made them to shift to reusable pads.

          <b>Segregation of sanitart waste at source by the females in India</b>
          <br><br>
          The segregation of menstrual waste plays a pivotal role in support for menstrual waste management. Communities should be aware of the barriers to menstrual hygiene management that girls face in school, as well as their role in enabling girls to successfully manage menses in school and at home. 39% of the female in the surveyed area mentioned and acknowledge the existence of the separate bins and they use them.

          <b>Knowledge on waste accumulation into environment by the females in India</b>
          <br><br>
          It is critical to understand the environmental effects of menstrual waste mismanagement to address its ill effects. It is essential to know of disposal mechanisms with usage in order to ensure sustainable management. Whether it is a cloth napkin or a sterile napkin, efforts must be taken that they are properly disposed. At home, one can dig a hole at the backyard and dump the sanitary pad/cloth/ napkin for drying and then burn it. Leaving it within the sand will delay decomposition and animals may drag it outside. The common disposal of single napkins is to wash the napkin and then wrap it in a newspaper/waste paper. Drop it into bins provided in the toilets. It is advisable for all toilets used by women to have such bins and some wrapping paper to ensure proper disposal mechanisms. Only 23% of females answered that waste ends up in the dump yard or landfills and many of the females don’t know exactly where the waste end up.
